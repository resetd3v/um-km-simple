# um-km-simple
comments everywhere cuz it was submitted as 1/3 components (included 3 way communication) for a project with a complete doc/writeup on every fucking routine

really shitty ioctl km um setup with extra stuff eg. websocket and curl impl

stuff removed that im gonna use in a project but u can put 2 and 2 together

you can change to nt api communication with 5 lines :3 (maybe not cuz no pattern scanning lib but go fetch ◣_◢)

barebones shit ngl but readable goat oop (in c) or what

should be build ready, if not change include directories and download whats needed, open a issue if its a headache like .lib need building ill include it in /libs
